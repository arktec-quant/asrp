# Agency Services Reflector Protocol (ARSP)

**ARSP** is a decentralized coordination protocol for secure, policy-driven discovery, registration, and governance of intelligent services across the Agentic Web. It enables **Agency Registered Entities (A.R.E.s)** to publish and manage their services (**A.R.E.S.**) through trusted reflector nodes called **Agency Services Reflectors (ASRs)**.

> ARSP is the foundational layer for interoperable, scalable, and ethically governed agent ecosystems — including human agents, AI systems, AI swarms, and AGI collectives.

## Key Concepts

- **A.R.E. (Agency Registered Entity):**  
  A digitally verifiable identity that represents a person, AI, organization, or system on the Agentic Web.

- **A.R.E.S. (Agency Registered Entity Services):**  
  Runtime service endpoints or capabilities offered by an A.R.E. (e.g., RPA bots, voting agents, inference APIs).

- **ASR (Agency Services Reflector):**  
  A policy-enforcing reflector node that validates, syncs, and propagates A.R.E.s and A.R.E.S. metadata across channels and swarm topologies.

- **ARSP (Agency Services Reflector Protocol):**  
  The protocol governing trusted coordination, metadata propagation, and channel-level policy enforcement for services in decentralized agent networks.
